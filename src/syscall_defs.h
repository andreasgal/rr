/**
 * Each known syscall is written as
 *
 *   SYSCALL_DEF*(name[, ...])
 *
 * These definitions comprise the syscalls known to rr.  The includer
 * should define SYSCALL_DEF*() macros, in the format described below,
 * that will do something with each syscall definition.  The
 * SYSCALL_DEF*() formats are
 *
 *   DEF[N](name, semantics[, type, reg...]) -> the syscall has N
 *   pairs of (type, register) args.  For example,
 *   |SYSCALL_DEF1(gettimeofday, EMU, struct timeval, arg1)| has one
 *   outparam arg in |arg1()| of size |sizeof(struct timeval)|.
 *
 *   DEF[N]_DYNSIZE(name, semantics[, dynamic-size, reg...]) -> like
 *   above, except that the N pairs are (dynamic-size, register) args.
 *   An arbitrary expression of the relevant Task |t| can be used to
 *   specify the size of each argument, for example |t->regs().syscall_result() *
 *   sizeof(int)|.
 *
 *   DEF_IRREG(name, irreg_semantics) -> the syscall doesn't fit a
 *   regular pattern; hand-written code is needed to process the
 *   syscall args.
 *
 *   DEF_UNSUPPORTED(name) -> the syscall is not yet supported by rr.
 *   rr will abort when seeing such a syscall (if the kernel does not return
 *   ENOSYS).
 *
 * |name| is the short syscall descriptor, e.g. "close".  For syscalls
 * other than DEF_IRREG(), replay |semantics| is one of
 *
 *   EMU: fully emulated syscall
 *   EXEC: fully executed syscall
 *   EXEC_RET_EMU: syscall is executed, but retval is emulated
 *   IRREGULAR: doesn't adhere to regular format (e.g. meta-syscalls
 *     like socketcall)
 *
 * For DEF_IRREG(), the replay |irreg_semantics| is one of
 *
 *   MAY_EXEC: syscall may be fully executed
 *   EMU: syscall will always be emulated
 *
 * System calls are ordered by system call number.
 * Use SYSCALLNO_X86(N) macro to set the system call number of the next system
 * call to N for x86.
 * By default the system call number is the number of the previous system call
 * plus one.
