/**
 * rr's "diverter" mode implements a third type of execution
 * control, in addition to "recorder" and "replayer".
 *
 * Diverter allows tracees to execute freely, as in "recorder"
 * mode, but doesn't attempt to record any data.  Diverter
 * emulates the syscalls it's able to (such as writes to stdio fds),
 * and essentially ignores the syscalls it doesn't know how to
 * implement.  Tracees can easily get into inconsistent states within
 * diversion mode, and no attempt is made to detect or rectify that.
 *
 * Diverter mode is designed to support short-lived diversions from
 * "replayer" sessions, as required to support gdb's |call foo()|
 * feature.  A diversion is created for the call frame, then discarded
 * when the call finishes (loosely speaking).
 *
 * TODO: it would probably be cleaner and simpler to make separate
 * *Session classes for each execution-control domain: RecordSession,
 * ReplaySession, and DiversionSession, then make execution control
 * part of those session classes.  That would entail creating
 * {record,replay,diversion}_session.cc files, and folding
 * {recorder,replayer,diverter}.cc into those as appropriate.
